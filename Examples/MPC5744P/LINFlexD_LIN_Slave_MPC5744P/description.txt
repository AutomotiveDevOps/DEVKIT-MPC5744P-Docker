DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: LINFlex Example
The Example configures MPC5744P PLL to 160 MHz and LINFlexD to LIN slave mode.
Receives "Hello" in slave mode. Then sends "World" back to master.
To be used alongside LINFlexD_LIN_Master_MPC5744P so two boards are needed.
One should be loaded with this program and the other should be loaded with the master program.
Flash the program then reset so both boards can run simultaneously.
