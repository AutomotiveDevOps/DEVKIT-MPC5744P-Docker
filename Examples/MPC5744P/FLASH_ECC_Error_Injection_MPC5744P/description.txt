DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: FLASH ECC Example
The purpose of the example is to show how to generate Multi-bit or Single-bit ECC error in internal FLASH
(user must choose it in the option at the end of main function).
Flash over-programming is used to generate a non-correctable (or single-bit) ECC error in FLASH.
The bad data is accessed then what's generate IVOR1 exception or FCCU_Alarm_Interrupt.
Both function calls MEMU handler.
The example also offers useful macros for MEMU module.
The example displays notices in the terminal window (connector J19 on MPC57xx_Motherboard)
(19200-8-no parity-1 stop bit-no flow control on eSCI_A).
No other external connection is required.
