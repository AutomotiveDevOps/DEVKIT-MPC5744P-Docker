DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: STOP0 mode Example
NOTE: This demo currently does not work when running from P&E debugger. It will get stuck trying to enter STOP0 mode!
For correct debugging flash the program, then disconnect and reset the board for it to run freely.
The exmaple is debugged with Lauterbach correctly.

This program tests the ability of the MPC574xP to enter into and wake up from STOP0 mode.
Before entering STOP mode, the PIT will be enabled to interrupt after 1 second.
The PIT interrupt will wake up the system from STOP mode and disable the PIT channel that did the waking up.
The interrupt will also toggle the blue LED six times.
Note that there is an errata for MPC5744P where an internal module sometimes cannot wake up system from STOP mode.
The first time, the red LED (PC11) will turn on.
When you wake up the MCU, that LED will turn back off.
The second time it enters STOP0 mode, the green LED (PC12) will turn on and turn back off when you wake up the part.
