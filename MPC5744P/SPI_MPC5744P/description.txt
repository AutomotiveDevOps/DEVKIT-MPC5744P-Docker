DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: SPI Example
The example configures PLL to 160 MHz, DSPI_1 to master, DSPI_2 to slave.
Slave sends 0x1234 to master.
Master sends 0x5678 to Slave. Slave receive buffer (RecDataSlave) gets 0x5678 and Master receive buffer (RecDataMaster) gets 0x1234.
Put a watch on RecDataMaster and RecDataSlave.
They will start at 0. Run the program and then pause.
RecDataSlave will be 0x5678 and RecDataMaster will be 0x1234.
The UART terminal will print the contents of the master and slave buffers before and after SPI transfer.
