DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: SIUL2 registers protection Example
In this example, SIUL2 registers are protected.
When protected, all writes to protected registers are ignored.
Program then unlocks the SIUL2 registers and attempts to write the same values to the previously protected registers.
Having been unlocked, the write will change the register values.
This code example has no terminal connection.
To check whether operation works, the flags 
LockedRegisterUnchanged, 
UnlockedRegisterChanged
RegisterLockMaintained
change from 0 to 1 to represent that the protection worked. 

Connect USB to PC terminal.
UART will print explanation messages to UART terminal.
