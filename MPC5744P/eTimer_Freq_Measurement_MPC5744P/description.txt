DEVKIT-MPC5744P board: eTimer Example
The example gives possible implementation of input signal period/freq measurement.
eTimer channel capture 1 and 2 features are used. CAPT1/CAPT2 capture counter value on rising/falling edge of input signal.
The FIFO is set to 2 entries and ICF2 is monitored.
Free-running mode is used here.

eTimer channel 0-1 are cascaded to achieve 1sec/1Hz measuring with 32bit counter.

 EVB connection:
   J5_3  - A[1]   eTimer0 channel1 input signal
   J1_16 - B[6]   CLKOUT signal provided by program. You can connect
   CLKOUT as input to eTimer0 channel 1 or you can use any external
   signal.

Connect pulse signal (J1_16) to eTimer0 channel 1 (J5_3)
See results on PC terminal such as TeraTerm (19200, 8N1, None).
Change freq/duty of input signal.
